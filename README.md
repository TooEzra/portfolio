Ezra Kipkoech's Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and background as a web developer and tech enthusiast. Built using vanilla HTML and CSS, this portfolio highlights my journey at Moi University, my hands-on projects, and my technical expertise.
Overview
This portfolio includes the following sections:

Home: A welcoming hero section with my introduction, tagline, and call-to-action buttons.
About: Details about my background, education at Moi University, and personal interests.
Projects: A gallery of projects I've worked on, including descriptions and demo links.
Skills: An overview of my technical skills with progress bars and stats.
Contact: Contact information and a footer with copyright details.

The design features a dynamic background image, a responsive layout, and interactive elements like hover effects, all crafted with vanilla HTML and CSS.
Features

Responsive design optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices (breakpoints at 1024px, 768px, and 480px).
Custom background images (hheey.png and tthere.png) for a unique aesthetic.
Skill progress bars and project cards with hover animations.
Semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO.
No JavaScript dependencies, relying solely on CSS for interactivity.

Prerequisites

A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
Optional: A local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python's http.server) for testing local files.

Installation
Clone or Download the Repository

Download the ZIP file from the repository or clone it using:
git clone <repository-url>


Replace <repository-url> with the URL of your GitHub repository if hosted.


Prepare the Files

Ensure the following files are in the same directory:
index.html
styles.css


Place your image files (hheey.png, tthere.png, profile.jpg, project1.jpg, project2.jpg, project3.jpg) in the same directory or update the paths in index.html and styles.css to match their locations (e.g., images/hheey.png).

Test Locally

Open index.html in a web browser. If images or styling donâ€™t load correctly, use a local server:
Install a server extension in VS Code (e.g., Live Server) and right-click index.html to open with Live Server.
Or, run python -m http.server 8000 in the terminal and visit http://localhost:8000.



Deploy (Optional)

Host the site on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static hosting service by uploading the files.

Usage

Navigate through the site using the sticky navigation bar.
Explore the "Projects" section to see my work (e.g., "The Deed Hostels Web App," "MULA," "Portfolio Builder"), with clickable "View Demo" links (currently placeholders; update with real URLs).
Review my skills and stats in the "Skills" section.

Customization

Images: Replace hheey.png, tthere.png, profile.jpg, project1.jpg, project2.jpg, and project3.jpg with your own images. Ensure paths in index.html and styles.css match their locations.
Content: Update the text in index.html (e.g., education, projects, skills) to reflect your latest details.
Styles: Modify styles.css to adjust colors, fonts, or layouts as needed (e.g., change background images or button styles).

Troubleshooting

Images Not Displaying: Verify file paths in index.html and styles.css. Use a local server if testing locally, as some browsers block direct file access. Check the browser console (F12) for 404 errors.
Responsive Issues: Test on different screen sizes and adjust media queries in styles.css if needed.
Styling Conflicts: Ensure background images (hheey.png, tthere.png) are correctly referenced and not corrupted.
