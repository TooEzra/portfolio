## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

-Images Not Displaying: Verify file paths in index.html and styles.css. Use a local server if testing locally, as some browsers block direct file access. Check the browser console (F12) for 404 errors.
-Responsive Issues: Test on different screen sizes and adjust media queries in styles.css if needed.
-Styling Conflicts: Ensure background images (hheey.png, tthere.png) are correctly referenced and not corrupted.

## 🎨 Customization

-Images: Replace hheey.png, tthere.png, profile.jpg, project1.jpg, project2.jpg, and project3.jpg with your own images. Ensure paths in index.html and styles.css match their locations.
-Content: Update the text in index.html (e.g., education, projects, skills) to reflect your latest details.
-Styles: Modify styles.css to adjust colors, fonts, or layouts as needed (e.g., change background images or button styles).
